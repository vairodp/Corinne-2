# Corinne
_This project presents an extension and improvement work by Corinne, a tool for reading, composing and projection of the Choreography Automata. These are an emerging model based on the concept of finite state automata mainly used for the top-down description of distributed systems choreographies. In particular, the project focuses on the implementation of the verification of Well-formedness, a fundamental characteristic of a c-automaton in order to ensure structural correctness, free from the typical errors of concurrent programming, such as Deadlocks and Race Conditions._

### Dependencies

- [Python3](https://www.python.org)
- [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) (0.10.1)
- [graphviz-python3-package](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/) (0.13.2)
- [antlr4-python3-runtime](https://pypi.org/project/antlr4-python3-runtime/) (4.7.2)
- [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (7.1.2)

### Running

Open a terminal in the main folder of Corinne and type:
```sh
python3 main.py
```

### Usage

- FILE MENU:
	- Open: takes in input DOT files (.gv) in CA syntax, but also it can get Chorgram file (.txt), a grammar used for Global Graph (See [Chorgram](https://bitbucket.org/emlio_tuosto/chorgram/wiki/Home)) and DOT files (.gv) generated by Domitilla (See [Domitilla](https://github.com/dedo94/Domitilla)) <br> and convert them into DOT files with CA syntax.

	For more details about the CA syntax see [DOT.g4](dot_parser/DOT.g4) file.

	- Open saved tabs: opens previously saved without the need to open file already opened in other sessions

Once taken one or more files as input, Corinne can apply some functions on it, under the "Trasformations" or verify Well-formedness properties under the "Properties":

- TRASFORMATIONS:
	- Product: a cartesian product of two CA ;
	- Synchronization: given a CA, it can synchronize two particants of its ;
	- Projection: given a CA, you can select one participant from it and get the relative CFSM (Communicating-FSA)

- PROPERTIES:
	- Well-formedness: verify both the "Well-sequencedness" and "Well-branchedness" properties.
	- Well-sequencedness: verify only the "Well-sequencedness" property.
	- Well-branchedness: verify only the "Well-branchedness" property.
